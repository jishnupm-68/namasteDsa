# note: Delete node in linked list: Use sentinel node
Leetcode problem no : 19 , Remove nth node from end of list

solution 1: 2Pass approach
    > Find the length
    > Find out the position where we need to remove.

# day 35 
Solution 2: 1Pass apporach
    > 2 Pointer approach
    > use sentinel node and first pointer starts from sentinel node
    > second pointer starts from nth node from the beginning 


Complexity of both approach are same
time complexity:  O(n)
space complexity : O(1)
