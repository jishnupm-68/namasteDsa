Leetcode problem no: 141, Linked List cycle

solution : store the node in set and check the existance till the node reach its end
====> time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n)



# day 30

Solution using : Floyd's cycle finding  Algorithm / slow and fast pointer approach
2 pointers used and one treated as slow pointer and another as fast pointer
If there is any cycle present, those two pointer will meet in a perticular point
====> time complexity : O(n), space complexity: O(1)
