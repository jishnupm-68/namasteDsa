# Time and Space Complexity  --> Day 6

# Time complexity
--> It is used to measure efficiency of algorithm in terms of speed, as the input size grows.
        => Time complexity !== Time taken
        > Linear Time complexity -> O(n)
        > Quadratic time complexity -> O(n^2)
        > Log time complexity -> O(log n)

        -> Big O notation --> Worst case
        -> Big Ω (Big Omega) --> Best-case performance
        -> Big Θ (Big Theta) --> Average / Tight bound


# Space complexity
--> The extra space used while running the program
